To import the Malmo GDB
Go to this page for the CE Manual which is very well documented
- http://cehelp.esri.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.procedural.cityengine.help/html/manual/cga/basics/toc.html
- Go to Manual -> Street Networks -> Importing Graph Networks -> Importing Graph Segments from GDB
*NOTABLY THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF IMPORTS AVAILABLE. THESE MAY BE WORTH LOOKING INTO
You will NOT be able to copy the buildings of Malmo exactly using this. You may use CGA Rules as per the below 
to create Malmo-esque buildings however, or you may use Maya or another 3D modeling program to attempt to create
buildings. Just know CE generates PROCEDURAL Buildings based upon the open spaces along streets in the street 
map you provide it, imported or not.
